        Silesia War Bot is war simulation inspired by <a id="link" href="https://worldwarbot.com/bots/" target="_blank">World War Bot</a>.
        There are 36 counties fighting for the hegemony over Silesia. Important factor of the victory is county score, based on <a id="link" href="https://katowice.stat.gov.pl/publikacje-i-foldery/roczniki-statystyczne/wojewodztwo-slaskie-2019-podregiony-powiaty-gminy,5,18.html" target="_blank">data</a> from 2018:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>population</li>
            <li>healthcare (hospital beds per 10k inhabitants and inhabitants per 1 healthcare entity)</li>
            <li>readership (book loans per inhabitant)</li>
            <li>net income (based on gross income and expenses)</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        To find initial score all features were scaled to values from 0 to 1, then the average of them was taken.
        During the war a score is calculated as mean value of scores of all subordinate counties. The score is then scaled to present probability of a new attack. 
        The higher the score is, the more likely is that the county will attack a neighbour. The game finishes when only one player lefts and the player controls all other counties.
